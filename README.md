A Learning-by-Building Journey Through Language Models

I found a [gem](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLAqhIrjkxbuWI23v9cThsA9GvCAUhRvKZ) of a resource for anyone who wants to go beyond just using GenAI tools — and instead dive deep into how they actually work.

This repo is my personal deep dive into building language models from scratch — inspired by [Andrej Karpathy](https://www.youtube.com/@AndrejKarpathy)’s excellent [Neural Networks: Zero to Hero](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLAqhIrjkxbuWI23v9cThsA9GvCAUhRvKZ) series.

I know I’m not the first (and definitely not the last) to share a makemore clone — but this one is mine. Every notebook here is a checkpoint in my own learning path, where I’ve explored concepts by building, breaking, and rebuilding.

Each notebook includes code, inline notes, and explanations — all written as I learned. No fancy abstractions, just raw, hands-on experimentation with ideas like bigrams, MLPs, transformers, and more.

**Note:** I'm uploading and polishing one notebook at a time. If you're reading this early — stay tuned! Things will grow here steadily.
